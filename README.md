As an NLP researcher, I have published my work in reputable journals and gained substantial teaching experience. My strong coding skills are reflected in the projects shared on this GitHub repository, which I now actively maintain. Although I initially underestimated GitHub's importance and ease of use.
In addition to NLP, DSA, and LeetCode, as well as blogging (focused on OOP concepts), I have participated in international hackathons, which enhanced my technical expertise and teamwork abilities.
